# Digit-Classifier-with-CNNs-on-MNIST-Dataset-Deployment-and-Feedback-Loop

This project focuses on building and deploying a Digit Classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the MNIST dataset. The workflow encompasses data preprocessing, CNN model creation, training, and evaluation. The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions. A user feedback loop is implemented, enabling users to provide input on prediction accuracy. Incorrect predictions are stored for future fine-tuning. A fine-tuning script automatically retrieves and utilizes stored feedback to update the model weights, enhancing its accuracy over time. The project combines machine learning, user interaction, and model refinement for an effective and dynamic solution.
